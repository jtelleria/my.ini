# To configure this host as a replication slave, you can choose between

#    the syntax is:
#
#    CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST=<host>, MASTER_PORT=<port>,
#    MASTER_USER=<user>, MASTER_PASSWORD=<password> ;
#
#    where you replace <host>, <user>, <password> by quoted strings and
#    <port> by the master's port number (3306 by default).
#
#    Example:
#
#    CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='125.564.12.1', MASTER_PORT=3306,
#    MASTER_USER='joe', MASTER_PASSWORD='secret';
#
# OR

# 2) Set the variables below. However, in case you choose this method, then
#    start replication for the first time (even unsuccessfully, for example
#    if you mistyped the password in master-password and the slave fails to
#    connect), the slave will create a master.info file, and any later

#    * With too Few Threads: There will be more stalls from Throttling.

#
# [VALUE RANGE]: -1 to 64.

# [DEFAULT]: rocksdb_max_background_jobs = 2.

#    * rocksdb_max_background_jobs = ("Number of Physical CPU Cores")/3.5

#
#    NOTE 2: With MariaDB => There is a Demand for More CPU above the RocksDB Storage Engine Layer -> To:
#	a) Read Queries -> From: Network.
#       b) Process Queries.
#       c) Send Results: Back to the Client. 

#
# [OPTIMAL ROCKSDB COMPACTATION VALUES STORAGE ENGINE LAYER]: Only RocksDB Engine Compactation Threads, NOT OS NOR MariaDB Server Threads.

# write_buffer_size:        Sets the size of a single memtable. Once memtable exceeds this size, it is marked immutable and
#                           a new one is created.It represents the amount of data to build up in memory (backed by an unsorted 
#                           log on disk) before converting to a sorted on-disk file. The default is 64 MB.
#                           You need to budget for 2 x your worst case memory use. If you don't have enough memory for this,
#                           you should reduce this value.
#                          
#                           "You can think of memtables as in-memory write buffers. Each new key-value pair is first written
#                           to the memtable. Memtable size is controlled by the option write_buffer_size. It's usually not a
#                           big memory consumer. However, memtable size is inversely proportional to write amplification
#                           -- the more memory you give to the memtable, the less the write amplification is.
#
#                           If you increase your memtable size, be sure to also increase your L1 size! L1 size is controlled by
#                           the option *"max_bytes_for_level_base"*.
#
#			    Baseline: 256 MB. Optimized 50/50 Snappy: 512MB
#
# max_bytes_for_level_base: Write amplification. *"max_bytes_for_level_base"* is total size of level 1. As mentioned, we recommend
#                           that this be around the size of level 0. Each subsequent level is *"max_bytes_for_level_multiplier"*
#                           larger than previous one. The default is 10 and we do not recommend changing that.

#
# target_file_size_base:    "Default Value is 64MB". Increasing "*target_file_size_base*" will reduce total number of database files, 
#                           which is generally a good thing. We recommend setting target_file_size_base to be 
#                           *"max_bytes_for_level_base*" / 10, so that there are 10 files in level 1".

# MyRocks Crash Recovery
#############################################################################################################################

# MyRocks supports crash recovery. Crash recovery is done by replaying transaction logs from WAL (Write Ahead Log) files. 
# MyRocks has a system variable rocksdb_wal_recovery_mode to control how to apply logs, if any of the WAL entries is corrupted. 
# This variable can be any of the following options:
#
# 0: If a corrupted WAL entry is detected as the last entry in the WAL, truncate the entry and start up normally; otherwise, 
#    refuse to start.
#
# 1 (default): If a corrupted WAL entry is detected, fail to start. This is the most conservative recovery mode.
#
# 2: If a corrupted WAL entry is detected in the middle of the WAL, truncate all of WAL entries after that (even though there
#    may be uncorrupted entries) and then start up normally. For Replication Slaves, this option is fine, since the slave 
#    instance can recover any lost data from the master without breaking consistency. For Replication Masters, this option
#    may end up losing data if you do not run failover. For example, if the master crashed and was restarted (by mysqld_safe,
#    or auto restart after OS reboot) with this mode and it silently truncated several WAL entries, the master would lose some
